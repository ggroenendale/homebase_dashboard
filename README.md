# Homebase Dashboard
The purpose of this project is to create a web app served from a locally hosted web server that can show various statistics and information on a large tv screen as if its 2356 A.D.

The app is primarily built upon PHP with the help of some javascript. There are also background scripts written in python to get data from the server such as case temperature, cpu speed, and hard drive usage.

Since the app is locally hosted it can also work on a mobile device connected to the same network. This will be useful to make simple forms to input extra information.

Future goals for the project include
* Financial and Budget information
    * Utilize the Plaid API
* Stock data
* Meal tracking information
* Using a network of Raspberry Pi's to track utility usage.
* Using sensors and Raspberry Pi's to track whats happening in a garden.
